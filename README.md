## Source code for 2.11BSD

This is the source code of 2.11BSD for the DEC PDP-11 series of minicomputers.

It has been modified somewhat for increased hack value.

Source code history has been partly reconstructed in the 'historic' branch.

### Building

You will need a real or emulated PDP-11 with 2.11BSD patchlevel 431, which is what you can find in the PUPS archives.

This 'src' tree should be converted to a tarball and placed in /usr/src to be built.

Building the system requires installation of the C compiler and will modify the host system.

You may find proper instructions here in the future.
